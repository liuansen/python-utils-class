Thanks for contributing to PyKafka. You can provide useful information that will
make root cause analysis easier and get your issue fixed more quickly.

First, please check the list of existing issues (open and closed) to ensure that
your issue hasn't already been filed by someone else. If applicable, feel free to
comment on or reopen old issues with fresh information.

Provide runnable code that replicates the issue if possible.
If using a consumer or producer, please include code that indicates how it was
instantiated, including keyword arguments.

Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to replicate the issue make diagnosing the
root cause easier. If possible, please include these as well.

When linking to specific lines of code in pykafka or other projects, please use
github permalinks. You can do this by pressing "y" on any github file view and then
creating a line link.
